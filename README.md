## search-results.txt
Domains which are maliciously crafted to deceive, and have been encountered in search engine results.

## email-stuff.txt
Anything found in conventional email phishing or spam attempts.

## seen-on-discord.txt
Any domains of bad nature, seen anywhere on Discord. Crypto, those bots spamming "leaked nudes" links, alleged Counter Strike skins, you name it. If it's unsavory and I've seen someone (or a bot) try to post it, then it goes here.

## sms-scams.txt
A collection of domains found on SMS scam texts (or as the cool kids call it, smishing). Most of these aren't actually mine, but from people who have either asked me if a text is real or shared it otherwise.
